Test Case Results for Each Test Object (without Coverage)
The table above shows each test object on the x axis and the number of test cases of the respective test 
object 
on the y axis. Each bar is divided into passed, not executed and failed test cases. The test case results 
do 
not take into account any coverage result (i.e. if all test cases of a test object are passed in this table but 
the 
coverage is failed, the overall test object result will be failed).
Branch (C1) Coverage: Total Branches for Each Test Object
The table above shows each test object on the x axis and the number of branches of the respective test object 
on 
the y axis. Each bar is divided into reached branches (i.e. branches that have been executed during the 
test) 
and unreached branches.

MC/DC Coverage: Total Condition Combinations for Each Test Object
The table above shows test objects on the x axis and the number of condition combinations of all decisions of 
the 
respective test object on the y axis. The number of condition combinations is based on the number of 
boolean 
conditions within each decision of the test object. To achieve full MC/DC coverage, each decision 
requires 
all contained atomic conditions to evaluate to both true and false independently of all other conditions. 
The 
cumulated number of rows within such tables of condition combinations is what is displayed in this table.
Each bar is divided into reached condition combinations (i.e. combinations of boolean condition values that 
have 
been executed during the test) and unreached condition combinations.

Test Object List
The following table lists all test objects with their test case and coverage results. The cumulated results for modules, folders and test collections are also displayed, the 
indentation 
within the name column indicates the parent relationship of the elements.
Please note that only test objects are numbered within the first column. This number is referenced on the x axis within the overview charts for test case and coverage results 
available 
on previous pages (if included into the report).
